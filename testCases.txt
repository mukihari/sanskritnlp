I'll help you create various test cases for different ways to query information about names in the Sahasranama, taking into account alternative spellings and different types of information requests.

Let me create comprehensive test cases covering different aspects:

## Spelling Variation Tests

1. Standard query with correct IAST spelling:

what have you got on Vishnu
explain yoga in detail
explain yoga in short
   - "What is the meaning of Viśvam?"
   - "Tell me about Bhūtabhavanaḥ"

2. Common English transliteration:
   - "What is the meaning of Vishvam?"
   - "Tell me about Bhutabhavanah"

3. Partial/incorrect diacritics:
   - "What is the meaning of Visvam?"
   - "Tell me about Bhūtabhavanah"
   - "Information on Bhutabhavanaḥ"

4. Missing diacritics completely:
   - "What is the meaning of Visvam?"
   - "Tell me about Bhutabhavanah"

## Position Queries

1. Direct position query:
   - "What position is Viśvam in the Sahasranama?"
   - "Which number is Bhūtabhavanaḥ in Vishnu Sahasranama?"

2. Reverse position query:
   - "Which name is at position 1 in the Sahasranama?"
   - "What is the 23rd name in Vishnu Sahasranama?"

3. Comparative position:
   - "Is Viśvam before Bhūtabhavanaḥ in the Sahasranama?"
   - "Which names come between Viśvam and Viṣṇuḥ?"

## Etymology Queries

1. Direct etymology requests:
   - "What is the prakṛyā of Viśvam?"
   - "Explain the derivation of Bhūtabhavanaḥ"

2. Root word queries:
   - "What is the dhātu of Viśvam?"
   - "From which root word is Bhūtabhavanaḥ derived?"

3. Grammatical formation:
   - "What pratyaya is used in forming Viśvam?"
   - "Explain the grammatical components of Bhūtabhavanaḥ"

## Meaning Queries

1. Direct meaning:
   - "What is the artha of Viśvam?"
   - "Explain the meaning of Bhūtabhavanaḥ"

2. Contextual meaning:
   - "Why is Vishnu called Viśvam?"
   - "How does the name Bhūtabhavanaḥ relate to Vishnu's qualities?"

3. Philosophical interpretation:
   - "What is the philosophical significance of Viśvam?"
   - "How does Bhūtabhavanaḥ reflect Vishnu's cosmic role?"

## Grammatical Queries

1. Gender queries:
   - "What is the liṅga of Viśvam?"
   - "Is Bhūtabhavanaḥ masculine or neuter?"

2. Word breakdown:
   - "What is the vigrahavākya of Viśvam?"
   - "Provide the word breakdown for Bhūtabhavanaḥ"

## Multi-property Queries

1. Combined information request:
   - "Tell me the position, meaning, and etymology of Viśvam"
   - "Give all information about Bhūtabhavanaḥ"


## Edge Cases

1. Multiple possible matches:
   - "Tell me about names related to 'bhūta' in the Sahasranama"
   - "Which names contain 'vi' in their root?"

2. Extremely misspelled but recognizable:
   - "What is the meaning of Vishwam?"
   - "Tell me about Bootabhavanah"

3. Ambiguous queries:
   - "What is Vishnu's first name?"
   - "Tell me about the universe name"




#Must do These

2. Comparative information:
   - "Compare the meanings of Viśvam and Viṣṇuḥ"
   - "How are the derivations of Viśvam and Bhūtabhavanaḥ different?"

## Complex Semantic Queries

1. Thematic grouping:
   - "Which names in the Sahasranama relate to Vishnu's universal form?"
   - "List all names related to protection in the Sahasranama"

2. Conceptual queries:
   - "Which name describes Vishnu as the creator of beings?"
   - "Is there a name that refers to Vishnu as all-pervading?"

3. Attribute-based search:
   - "Find names in Sahasranama with neuter gender"
   - "Which names use the root 'viś' in their formation?"

These test cases should cover a wide range of query variations that your system might encounter, testing its ability to handle spelling variations, different information requests, and various ways users might formulate their questions.
