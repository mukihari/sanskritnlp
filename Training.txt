Step-by-Step Editing Guide
When you want to make changes yourself, follow these steps:

For adding new names or editing existing ones:

Edit the dictionary.py file to add or modify entries in the vishnu_sahasranama dictionary
Follow the structure of your example with prakṛyā, vigrahavākya, artha, liṅga, and position


For improving name recognition:

Add common spelling variations to the dictionary or a separate mapping
Adjust the fuzzy matching threshold in _fuzzy_search_names


For enhancing query types:

Add new keywords to the intents dictionary
Create a new response format in the _format_response method
Implement any specialized logic in the process_query method


For concept-based searching:

Add concept groups in the _build_concept_mappings method
Ensure names have detailed artha fields for automatic concept extraction



Testing Your Changes
After making edits:

Print debug information by setting debug_mode = True in the process_query method
Test with various spellings and query types
Add print statements to see how entities are being extracted and matched

This approach will help you understand how the system works and make targeted edits with minimal outside help.
