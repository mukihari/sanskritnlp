Project Structure:
-----------------

/vishnu_nirukti_project/
├── app.py                  # Main Flask application (entry point)
├── sanskritphonetic.py     # Sanskrit Phonetic Engine
├── sanskrit_nlp.py         # Sanskrit NLP System
├── dictionary_108.py       # Vishnu Ashtottaram dictionary
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── templates/              # Flask HTML templates
│   └── index.html          # Main interface template
└── static/                 # Static assets (if needed)
    └── css/                # CSS stylesheets (if needed)
       └── custom.css       # Custom styles (if needed)

Setup Instructions:
-----------------

1. Create a new project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir vishnu_nirukti_project
   cd vishnu_nirukti_project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   
   # Activate the virtual environment:
   # On Windows:
   env\\Scripts\\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Create the following Python files:
   - sanskritphonetic.py (Sanskrit Phonetic Engine)
   - sanskrit_nlp.py (Sanskrit NLP System)
   - dictionary_108.py (already exists with the Vishnu Ashtottaram dictionary)
   - app.py (Flask Web Interface)

4. Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
   ```
   Flask==2.0.1
   fuzzywuzzy==0.18.0
   python-Levenshtein==0.12.2
   ```

5. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. The app.py file will automatically create the templates directory and index.html file
   when run for the first time.

7. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

8. Open a web browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:8000

Troubleshooting:
--------------

1. If you encounter any issues with dictionary import, make sure the dictionary_108.py file 
   is in the same directory as the other Python files.

2. If you get an error about missing templates, make sure the app has permission to create
   the templates directory and write files to it.

3. For any other issues, check the application logs for error messages.

Additional Notes:
---------------

1. The application uses port 8000 by default. You can change this in the app.py file
   if needed.

2. The debug mode is enabled by default, which is useful during development but should
   be disabled in production.

3. The Sanskrit Phonetic Engine and NLP System are designed to work together, with the
   phonetic engine handling the low-level text processing and the NLP system providing
   higher-level functionality.

4. The web interface includes a debug mode that can be enabled for development and
   troubleshooting.
